# Polygence Coding Challenge

The coding challenge portion of the Polygence Engineering interview!

## Project overview

It is a simple application where you can track your spendings.

A spending has the followings properties:

    - when it happened (gives automatically the date and number when you added the spending)
    - how much did we spend ( 200 equals 2. So what you write it is with decimals)
    - in what currency (HUF or USD)
    - for what/description

This simple web app allows the users to:

       - Create a new spending
       - List all the spendings
       - List all the spendings ordered by amount, date
       - List all the spendings filtered by currency

## Building up the project

###This only work if you have Docker to run with

You have to open the project folder in terminal or interpreter (such as VS code).
After you just have to run "docker-compose up" and it builds everything up for you

##It is ready on localhost:3000
##unluckily my frontend server is not able to reach the backend server. But docker doesn't show me the core of the problem.
