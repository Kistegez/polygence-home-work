# Polygence Coding Challenge

The coding challenge portion of the Polygence Engineering interview!

## Project overview

It is a simple application where you can track your spendings.

A spending has the followings properties:

    - when it happened (gives automatically the date and number when you added the spending)
    - how much did we spend ( 200 equals 2. So what you write it is with decimals)
    - in what currency (HUF or USD)
    - for what/description

This simple web app allows the users to:

       - Create a new spending
       - List all the spendings
       - List all the spendings ordered by amount, date
       - List all the spendings filtered by currency

## Building up the project

You have to open the project folder in terminal or interpreter (such as VS code).

pip requirements:
After you have to run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt. You can do it globally or if you want to 
you can create a virtual environment for it (mkdir venvfolder -> in the folder: python3 -m venv env -> source env/bin/activate and
after all run the pip install -r requirements.txt).
